- Online!
  - Stackoverflow has human beings that answer questions, try it sometime.
  - Github repos for gems or other projects have real people behind them.


###Code Challenge One (Javascript Racer): 

Before we kick off with our first challenge let talk about pairing! You're not going alone in your ventures into Javascript land and it's important we're all on the same page about how pairing works. Check out [this video called 'Pairing is Caring'](http://vimeo.com/76662569) and have a discussion with your pair on how you want the challenge to work for the two of you. Then, get into it!

This challenge is a quick way to get a few Javascript fundamentals under your belt. We'll to build a fun and interactive game that runs soley in your browser (i.e.Chrome, Firefox). After completing the challenge you will be able to:
* Define jQuery callback events
* Change the DOM based on events
* Write custom event handlers in JavaScript and jQuery
* Build a pure JavaScript application

So without further delay, [let's get into the magic with Javascript Racer!](javascript-racer.md)

If you've found that you've *raced through* this challenge, we've got just the thing for you and your pair. Check out this new challenge [Roman Numerals](roman-numerals.md). It'll give you a taste of Ruby or C#.

###Engineering Empathy

Developing soft-skills is a strong theme of Enspiral Dev Academy. However regardless of your profession, the skills fostered through such reflection and self-awareness are extremyly beneficial. Today we will be diving a little into xxxxxxxxxx with Joshua Vial, one of EDA's co-founders.

If you find this stuff interesting check out [this video](http://vimeo.com/82610073) where you get a little more insight on what Dev Bootcamp tries to get out of EE and also chek out [this book](http://www.siyli.org/learn-more/read-the-book/) which the Engineering Empathy content is based upon.

###Code Challenge Two (A-mazing Javascript)

We will be mixing up our pairs again this afternoon. It's up to you who you want to work with, but maybe have a conversation first around prior experience and what they want to get out of the challenge. Once you've paired up, make sure you have your conversation based on what you learnt from pairing is caring.

This afternoon we're going to take a step up and push our skills a little. If you found this morning too challenging and would like some help, grab a coach and request a breakout. Let them know what you're having difficulties with and work through it together.

This second challenge, A-mazing Javascript, will introduce a few new Javascript and JQuery concepts and will also push your creative thinking.

So without futher adieu, [let's get going!](a-mazing-javascript.md)

###Additional challenges

Want a quick taste of Ruby or C#? Try [this challenge](roman-numerals.md). We're going to build a cypher for turning integers into Roman Numerals. Now if tht doesn't sound useful in your everyday life then you're doing something wrong!
